a/ Documentation
In this project, I focused on several key concepts:

HTML Structure: I learned to effectively structure an HTML document, including elements such as the <nav>, <table>, and <div> for content organization.
TailwindCSS: Utilizing TailwindCSS allowed me to implement a utility-first approach for styling. I applied various Tailwind classes to create a responsive layout and visually appealing components.
Responsive Design: I learned to use responsive modifiers in TailwindCSS to ensure that the website adapts well to different screen sizes, enhancing user experience.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in combining HTML and TailwindCSS to create a cohesive design.

b/ Reflection
I learned the importance of clean code and how a well-structured layout improves readability and maintenance. The most significant challenge I faced was ensuring the responsive design worked across different devices. At first, certain elements did not align correctly on smaller screens.

To overcome this, I experimented with different TailwindCSS classes, using utilities like flex, grid, and responsive breakpoints. Testing the website on various devices allowed me to identify issues early, leading to timely adjustments.

Hereâ€™s a screenshot demonstrating the responsive layout issue I encountered (if applicable, insert screenshot here).

c/ Clarity & Coherence
Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience. I effectively applied HTML and TailwindCSS to create a responsive college website. The process highlighted the significance of user interface design and how responsive features can greatly enhance user interaction. The skills and knowledge I acquired will be beneficial for future web development projects.
