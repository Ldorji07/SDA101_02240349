Main Concepts Applied:
I created an HTML table to display assignment results, including modules, assignments, maximum marks, marks obtained, percentages, and grades. I used the CSS properties border and border-collapse to define the tableâ€™s appearance, ensuring a clean and organized look. Additionally, I applied hover effects to table cells to enhance user interaction.

What I Learned:
This project enhanced my understanding of using HTML tables to present structured data clearly. I learned how to utilize CSS to improve the aesthetics and functionality of the table, making it more engaging for users. The hover effect added a dynamic touch, encouraging users to interact with the table.

Challenges Faced:
A challenge I encountered was ensuring the table was visually appealing while remaining easy to read. Initially, some color choices made the text difficult to see. I resolved this by adjusting the background colors and ensuring good contrast, which improved readability.
