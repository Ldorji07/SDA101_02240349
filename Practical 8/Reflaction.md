Main Concepts Applied:
I created an HTML form for reporting maintenance issues, adding input fields, radio buttons, a dropdown list, and a text area. In CSS, I styled the submit button to be more interactive with effects on hover and active states, using properties like border-radius, box-shadow, and transform to enhance the buttonâ€™s appearance and usability.

What I Learned:
This project improved my skills in combining HTML and CSS to create user-friendly forms. I learned how adding simple button effects in CSS can make interactions more engaging and how small touches, like background color changes on hover, contribute to a more professional-looking design.

Challenges Faced:
One challenge was managing overlapping styles for the button, as I accidentally had two hover effects that clashed. After noticing, I adjusted the CSS to keep only one hover style, ensuring consistency. This helped me better understand the importance of keeping CSS organized.
