Main Concepts Applied:
I used HTML to create an ordered list of events with nested unordered lists for event details (time and location). In CSS, I styled the table using border and border-collapse to improve the table’s appearance, and used a class for text color adjustments.

What I Learned:
This project helped me understand how to apply CSS to enhance HTML structures, like adding borders for clarity and adjusting colors for emphasis. I also learned how organized CSS can make a webpage look more professional and clear.

Challenges Faced:
One challenge was keeping the layout consistent, as the nested lists and table borders didn’t initially align. To fix this, I adjusted padding and used border-collapse to make the table look cleaner.
