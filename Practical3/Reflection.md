a/ Documentation
Main Concepts Applied:
In this project, I used HTML to create ordered and unordered lists to organize content. I also nested lists to structure topics and subtopics effectively.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired:
I improved my understanding of HTML lists and practiced arranging information in a structured way, which helped me make the page more organized and readable.

b/ Reflection
What I Learned:
I learned how to create organized, easy-to-read content using HTML lists. This project showed me how effective HTML can be in making structured layouts.

Challenges Faced and Solutions:
One challenge I faced was aligning the nested lists correctly, as they appeared differently depending on the browser used. To resolve this, I adjusted the arrangement to ensure it looked aligned across different browsers.

c/ Clarity & Coherence
I kept my reflection well-organized by using clear sections, making it easy to read and understand.

This version stays focused on HTML concepts and is simple and clear. Let me know if you need any more adjustments!
