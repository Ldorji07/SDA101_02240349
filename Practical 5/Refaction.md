Main Concepts Applied:
I used HTML table elements (<table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>) to build a clear course schedule. The table layout helped organize days of the week as columns and time slots as rows.

What I Learned:
I improved my skills in structuring data with tables and learned how headers make schedules easier to read.

Challenges Faced:
Initially, I misplaced a few subjects in the wrong time slots. I fixed this by carefully checking each entry against my actual schedule.
