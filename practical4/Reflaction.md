a/ Documentation
Main Concepts Applied:
In this project, I applied foundational HTML concepts to create a form for seminar registration. This included using <form>, <label>, and various input elements like text, date, radio buttons, email, password, number, and dropdown lists. I also structured the form for better readability by grouping related elements and labeling each input for accessibility.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired:
I improved my understanding of how HTML forms work and learned about different input types and how they apply to user data collection. For example, using the <select> element for meal preference and <input type="date"> for date of birth were new concepts that allowed for more structured data input.

b/ Reflection
What I Learned:
Through this project, I learned how to set up a basic HTML form that is both functional and user-friendly. Labeling each input field with the correct <label> tag was essential to making the form accessible, and it helped me understand the importance of usability in web design.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions:
One challenge I faced was getting the form layout to appear evenly spaced and aligned. Initially, the form inputs didnâ€™t line up correctly, which made the form look cluttered. To address this, I adjusted the labels and simplified the layout to make it clearer.


Before: Inputs were misaligned due to inconsistent labeling.
After: Adjusted labels to align form elements correctly.
